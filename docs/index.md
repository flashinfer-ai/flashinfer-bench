FlashInfer-Bench is a comprehensive benchmark and infrastructure designed to create a "virtuous cycle" where AI can automatically optimize and improve the core GPU kernels of the AI systems it runs on. It provides a systematic framework to identify performance bottlenecks, generate solutions, and deploy them immediately into production.

- **Standardized Schema**: It introduces "FlashInfer Trace," a standardized format to clearly describe GPU kernel workloads, solutions, and results for both AI agents and human engineers.

- **Real-World Benchmarks**: The benchmark datasets are curated from actual, production-grade LLM serving traffic, ensuring that optimizations are relevant and impactful.

- **Seamless Deployment**: It enables "zero-day" integration, allowing new, high-performance kernels to be immediately swapped into live LLM engines with minimal effort.

- **Performance Tracking**: A public leaderboard visualizes and ranks kernel performance, helping developers prioritize optimization efforts on the most critical components.
